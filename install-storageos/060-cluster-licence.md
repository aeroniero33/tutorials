StorageOS clusters need a licence to operate after 24 hours. However, creating
a developer licence is easy to do and completely free!

To create a licence click on the StorageOS UI Licence tab of the terminal and
click on the `Sign Up` button under the Developer Licence box. Don't forget to
activate the account in your email after account creation. Follow the
instruction and congratulations, you now have a working and fully licensed
StorageOS cluster!

For more information about our licences, check
https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/licence/. Also, feel free to join our
public slack channel https://slack.storageos.com/ where we provide support,
guidance and are happy to answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for completing this tutorial!
