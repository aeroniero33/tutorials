StorageOS serves the GUI on the port 5705 of each DaemonSet Pod.

Access the GUI by clicking on the Dashboard tab of the terminal. Log in with
the same credentials as set in the Secret.

Username: `storageos`
Password: `storageos`

We would recommend to check the Volumes, Nodes, Cluster and License sections to
experiment with the GUI.

If you see any issues, you should disable ad-block and privacy checkers on the new window.
